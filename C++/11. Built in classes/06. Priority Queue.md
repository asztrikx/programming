> Values ordered by priority  
> Values order according to operator `<`  
> The value taken out will be least significant in priority because(?) it uses `heap`. We can fix that by reversed priority (not complementer!).  

# Declaration
```c++
#include <queue>
```
```c++
struct type{
	//...
	bool operator<(type other) const {
		return //...
	}
};
```
```c++
priority_queue<type> pq;
```

# Time Complexity
| Property |  Time  |
| -------- | ------ |
| push     | log(N) |
| empty    | 1      |
| top      | 1      |
| pop      | log(N) |
| size     | 1      |
