//use positive edges  
//use bfs for path finding as it is proveable that it will have O(N**3) time  
//multiple source, sink -> create main source, sink: connect it to sources and sinks  
//limits are on the nodes, not on the edges -> duplicate nodes and create edge between them with the limit  
//undirected graph -> create to directed edges, it can be proven that it will work
